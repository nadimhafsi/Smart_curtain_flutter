#Automated Curtain System    
      
The Automated Curtain System project aims to create a system capable of controlling the opening and closing of curtains automatically based on various conditions such as ambient light or manual commands. To achieve this, the system utilizes light sensors (LDR), a motion sensor (PIR), and a servo motor to actuate the curtains. Communication between the system and the user is facilitated through the MQTT protocol, enabling remote control and scheduling of actions.     
     
     
## Introduction   
    
The Automated Curtain System is designed to automate the operation of curtains, allowing for convenient control based on environmental factors and user commands. By leveraging light sensors (LDR), a motion sensor (PIR), and a servo motor, the system can intelligently open and close curtains in response to ambient light levels and user inputs.    
    
Key Features:       
- **Manual and Automatic Control**: Users can choose between manual and automatic       
modes to control the curtains.        
- **Motion Detection**: Curtains automatically open when motion is detected (automatic    
mode).    
- **Automatic Adjustment Based on Light**: Curtains open or close automatically based    
on ambient light.    
- Scheduling: Users can schedule specific times for opening and closing the curtains.    
- **MQTT Communication**: Utilizes MQTT protocol for communication between the     
system and the mobile application.
